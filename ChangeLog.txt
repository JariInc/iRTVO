	See "nlog.config.sample" for a sample
+ Commandline parameter "-debug" will disable catching of unhandled exceptions
= Complete rewrite of Bookmark-handling:

	+ Bookmarks store CAM , PlaySpeed and focussed Driver
	+ new SubProject "iRTVOPlayer" to playback bookmarks. (ui less PoC Version)
= All cross-thread used collection have been wrapped into ObservableCollection
+ DriverInfo: Added access to ExternalData (data.csv) from DriverInfo and scripts
+ LapInfo: Added LapTime_HR 
= StandingsItem: 
	+ FastestLap_HR 
	+ AirTimeCount ( how often a driver was focussed )
	+ AirTimeAirTime ( AirTime of driver in seconds )
	+ AirTimeAirTime_HR ( human readable )
	+ IsFollowedDriver ( Observable through PropertyChanged-Event )
= SessionInfo
	+ made CurrentSession Observable through PropertyChanged-Event
+ new Trigger: init
		Will be called after the theme is completely loaded and ready to go. Can be used e.g. to show overlays/images by default without making them "fixed" and unhideable.
		Sample:
		[Trigger-init]
		show=Image-Main,Image-Watermark
+ new Triggers:
		offTrack        Driver went OffTrack. Dataset = trigger
        notInWorld		Driver left car. Dataset = trigger
        pitIn       	Driver entering pilane.  Dataset = trigger
        pitOut	        Driver leaving pitlane.  Dataset = trigger
        pitOccupied		Any driver is in Pit. Dataset = pit , only active in race sessions
        pitEmpty		No driver is in Pit. Dataset = pit , only active in race sessions
+ new Datasets:
	trigger             usable when a driver fires a trigger (like pitIn, pitOut etc )
	pit					will return all drivers currently in pit
* Access to shared list wrapped into an objectlock to prevent threading issues.
* Bugfix to startup code (api-connection retry)
= Replaced ini-file handling by more flexible code
+ Added support for animated GIF. Add "animate=true" to the [Image-]-Section to enable.
+ Made "OverlaySession" a Cross-Client-Synchronized property. Changing Session in Client will change it on all clients and the server.
* Changes of Cam/Focus in iRacing Sim will be broadcasted to all clients.
* hiding a Video/Music will stop playing it.
+ new option for Videos/Music:
	volume=[0-100] in Percent. Default = 100%
+ Added access to ExternalData to scripts: Dictionary<int, string[]> extData = IHost.getExternalData();
= Scripts are no longer loaded through evaluator to enable referencing Assemblies not in the main executable 
	e.g.: //css_reference MyCustomAssembly.dll
+ new StandingsItem Variable (69): {inpit} defines if the driver is currently in the pits
+ Added Support for RivalTracker to livetiming-interface. The current release is added. Grab updates from https://github.com/SamHazim/RivalTracker
+ General Errors are shown in Statusline of MainWindow
+ new Pseudo-Script "Push" to emulate a Trigger
   Sample:
   [Button-EmuYellow]
   text="Yellow Flag!"
   script=Push-flagYellow
+ new remote Commands:
	"CHGSESSION <sessionid>" - Change Server Session
	"SWITCH <DriverPlate> <CamID>" - Switch Cam and Focus in one step
	"SENDCAMS" - Ask Server to send list of Cams. Reply: "ADDCAM <CamID> <CamName>"
	"SENDDRIVERS" - Ask Server to send Drivers. Reply: "ADDDRIVER <Caridx> <Fullname>"
	"SENDBUTTONS" - Ask Server to send Buttons. Reply: "ADDBUTTON <ButtonName> <ButtonText>"
+ made Bookmarks editable from Drivers-Window

	If "cambuttonrow" = true , in the MainWindow <totalNumberOfCams>/camsperrow Columns will be added holding Buttons to switch cams.
	Camares in the list "camsnobutton" will not get a button.

	[Overlay]
	showborders=True|False

	show a yellow border arond all overlay, to make positioning more easy

	Invalid Columns will be silently ignored ( List of available columns wil be dumped to logfile )
